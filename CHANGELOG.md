## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- **Smart compact (I-aware).** Planning and execution compaction now slices
  history by `I-###` implementation items instead of `[DONE:VC-xxx]` markers.
  The current-I slice above 20% of the model window triggers a bounded
  summary with paired `Read: <path> line <X-Y> Extracted information summary: ...`
  records, retains a legal recent suffix, targets <10% post-context, and
  records a hard-floor reason when unreachable. Planning falls back to the
  latest plan/Q&A focus when no current marker exists. Pi core still owns
  threshold, overflow, and manual scheduling; cooldown + resume guard prevent
  ping-pong; hidden resume messages stay out of model context.
- **Visible Refiner overlay.** Delegated reviewer/criticizer rounds now
  surface a named public `Reviewer`/`Criticizer` overlay in the Pi TUI with
  per-lane tool progress, bounded output preview, and clean cancelled/
  timed-out vs completed terminal states. The overlay opens at round start
  and closes before the tool result returns to the main session. Built on
  Pi's public `pi-tui` primitives — no `pi-btw` dependency.
- **Auto-complete mode.** `ask_choice` routes eligible planning and refinement
  questions through a run-scoped Auto-complete mode. Use
  `/plans-autocomplete-stop` to take back control; Auto-complete is never
  offered for execution approval, installs, publishing, deployment, merge,
  push, or credential use.
- **Planning write guard with `set-artifact-root`.** While a run is
  `planning`/`accepted`, `edit`/`write` is blocked outside `.git/pi_plans/`,
  the run's artifact directory, and `~/.cache/pi-plans/`. The artifact root
  is configurable through the new `set-artifact-root` action.

### Changed

- README now links directly to the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)
  and documents Smart Compact and Visible Refiner overlay behavior.
- Subagent invocation moved to a minimal JSONL-driven runner; the renderer no
  longer depends on `pi-btw` or any third-party view package.

### Removed

- Legacy execution model snapshot/selection helpers
  (`setExecutionModel`, `chooseExecutionModelSelection`,
  `snapshotCurrentModelSelector`, `ensureExecutionModelActive`,
  `restorePlanningModel`).
- Standalone execution-list widget and `/plans-list` toggle; progress lives in
  the bottom status bar throughout.
